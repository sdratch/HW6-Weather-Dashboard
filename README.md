# HW6-Weather-Dashboard
This assignment was to construct a weather dashboard using the open weather api

When a city is searched:
The current weather is displayed including current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index.
The uv index is color codded to be green for good, orange for warning, and red for dangerous
A five day forcast is also displayed below the current weather with date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity
it is then added to the previous search results below

Clicking a previous search result will also display that cities weather and weather forcast.

When refreshing the page or going back to it: The last city searched should be displayed in the current weather and the weather forcast
